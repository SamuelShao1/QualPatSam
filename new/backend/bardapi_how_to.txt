The bard api access is gimmicky at best in its current state

Official access to the api is waitlisted (can maybe ask if we could get priority access)

There is an unofficial github repo that lets you access Bard

https://github.com/dsdanielpark/Bard-API

It uses a cookie value that is associated with your Google Account, this cookie value changes every once in a while

thus to test this out locally here are the steps to follow

1. use pip to install bardapi, run the following command

    pip install bardapi

2. (this will be changed to use environmental variable or maybe an automatic cookie scraper) 
the token hardcoded is likely to have expired since the last time someone tried using it

you need to log into https://bard.google.com/

press F12 to pull up developer menu, go to cookies and copy the cookie value for the one named "__Secure-1PSID"

into the token parameter of the call to instantiate Bard

bard = Bard(token='your token here')

then it should work, if it doesn't work the first time, try clearing your cookies and logging back into Bard,
sometimes the cookie will have changed

This is the error I was getting when the cookie had expired:

Exception: SNlM0e value not found. Double-check __Secure-1PSID value or pass it as token='xxxxx'.
